### **Key Sections in README.md**:

1. **Project Overview**: Describes the purpose of the project and its core functionality.
2. **Technologies Used**: Lists the technologies used (e.g., .NET 9, OpenAI API).
3. **Getting Started**: Instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the project.
4. **Sample Test JSON**: Provides an example of the input data (insurance claim) and the expected output (decision).
5. **API Usage**: Explains how to interact with the API to generate claim decisions.

### **Next Steps**:

- **Test the API**: Once everything is set up, use the provided **sample claim JSON** to test the API and verify that it returns the correct decision.
- **Add More Features**: You could enhance the model by adding more features like multi-step claim verification or additional claim types.

# InsuranceClaimAI
uses GPT-4 model to get decisions on submitted Motor damage Insurance Claims
# Insurance Claim Decision Model

This project uses a **GPT-4** based model fine-tuned for making **insurance claim decisions**. The model is capable of analyzing insurance claim details and generating decisions (approve or reject) based on the provided data. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques and works within the **.NET 9** environment.

## Features

- **LLM Prompting**: Uses GPT-4 model to generate responses based on insurance claims data.
- **Claim Decision Making**: Makes insurance claim decisions (approve/reject) based on claim details like damage description, claim amount, and policy coverage.
- **API Integration**: Exposes the model as a service using **.NET 9 API** with FastAPI for Python integration.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for failed API requests.
- **Optimized for Insurance Industry**: The model is optimized for processing claims in the insurance industry, specifically for vehicle claims.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 9**: For creating and managing the API and services.
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 model for generating decisions.
- **FastAPI** (Python): For exposing the fine-tuned GPT-4 model as an API.
- **JSON**: Data format used for communication and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK installed
- Python (for interacting with the OpenAI model and FastAPI)
- OpenAI API key
